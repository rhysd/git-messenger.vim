INTRODUCTION                                        *git-messenger-introduction*

*git-messenger.vim* is a Vim/Neovim plugin to reveal the hidden message under
the cursor quickly. It shows the last commit message under the cursor in popup
window.

When you modifying unfamiliar codes, you would sometimes wonder 'why was this
line added?' or 'why this value was chosen?' in the source code. The answer
sometimes lays in a commit message, especially in message of the last commit
which modifies the line.

This plugin shows the message of the last commit in a 'popup window'. The
popup window is implemented in

- Floating window on Neovim 0.4 or later
- Preview window on Vim 8+ or Neovim 0.3 or earlier

The floating window is definitely recommended since it can shows the
information near the cursor.

If you see some error message, please try |git-messenger-health-check|.

To enable a floating window support, you need to install Neovim 0.4 or later.
The version is not yet released, so you need to install Neovim by building
from source at this point. If you use macOS, it's quite easy with Homebrew.
>
  $ brew install neovim --HEAD

COMMANDS                                                *git-messenger-commands*

*:GitMessenger*

  It opens a popup window with the last commit message which modified the line
  at cursor. The popup window shows following contents:

  - History: Number of history. In popup window, h/l navigates to previous or
    next commit.
  - Commit: The commit hash
  - Author: Author name and mail address of the commit
  - Committer: Committer name and mail address of the commit when
    comitter is different from author
  - Summary: First line after a comitter header line is a summary of commit
  - Body: After summary, commit body is put (if the commit has body)

  The popup window will be automatically closed when you move the cursor so
  you don't need to close it manually.

  Running command again after the popup window shows up moves the cursor into
  the window. This behavior is useful when the commit message is too long and
  window cannot show the whole content. By moving the cursor into the popup
  window, you can see the rest of contents by scrolling it. This behavior can
  be suppressed with |g:git_messenger_into_popup_after_show|.

  Following mappings are defined within popup window.

  | Mapping | Description                                            |
  | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
  | q       | Close the popup window                                 |
  | o       | "o"lder. Back to older commit at the line              |
  | O       | Opposite to older. Forward to newer commit at the line |
  | ?       | Show mappings help                                     |

*:GitMessengerClose*

  Though a popup window is automatically closed by default, it closes the
  popup window explicitly. It is useful when you set
  |g:git_messenger_close_on_cursor_moved| to |v:false|.


==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                                                *git-messenger-mappings*

Some <Plug> mappings are available to operate a popup window. They can be mapped to your favorite
key sequences. For example:

  The same as running |:GitMessenger| command.

*<Plug>(git-messenger-close)*

  The same as running |:GitMessengerClose| command.

*<Plug>(git-messenger-into-popup)*

  Moves the cursor into the popup window. It's useful when you want to scroll
  the content and close the window.

*<Plug>(git-messenger-scroll-down-1)*

*<Plug>(git-messenger-scroll-up-1)*

  Scroll up the popup window by 1 line directly.

*<Plug>(git-messenger-scroll-down-page)*

*<Plug>(git-messenger-scroll-up-page)*

  Scroll up the popup window by 1 page directly.

*<Plug>(git-messenger-scroll-down-half)*

==============================================================================
VARIABLES                                              *git-messenger-variables*

Some global variables are available to configure the behavior of this plugin.


*g:git_messenger_close_on_cursor_moved* (Default: |v:true|)

  When this value is set to |v:false|, a popup window is no longer closed
  automatically when moving a cursor after the window is shown up.

*g:git_messenger_git_command* (Default: "git")

  "git" command to retrieve commit messages. If your "git" executable is not
  in "$PATH" directories, please specify the path to the executable.

*g:git_messenger_no_default_mappings* (Default: |v:true|)

  When this value is set to |v:false|, it does not define any key mappings.
  <Plug> mappings are still defined since they don't make any conflict with
  existing mappings.

*g:git_messenger_into_popup_after_show* (Default: |v:true|)

  When this value is set to |v:false|, run |:GitMessenger| or
  |<plug>(git-messenger)| again after showing a popup does not move the cursor
  in the window.

*g:git_messenger_always_into_popup* (Default: |v:false|)

  When this value is set to |v:true|, the cursor goes into a popup window when
  running |:GitMessenger| or |<Plug>(git-messenger)|.

*g:git_messenger_preview_mods* (Default: "")

Command modifiers for opening preview window. The value will be passed as
prefix of |:pedit| command.
For example, setting "botright" to the variable opens a preview window at
bottom of the current window. Please see |<mods>| for more details.

NOTE: This variable is effective only when opening preview window (on Neovim
      (0.3.0 or earlier) or Vim).


==============================================================================
HIGHLIGHTS                                            *git-messenger-highlights*

|git-messenger.vim| sets sinsible highlight colors to popup menu for light and
dark colorschemes by default. However, it may not match to your colorscheme.
In the case, you can specify your own colors to popup window in nvim/init.vim
by defining highlights as follows.. This is only available on Neovim.

Example:
>
  " Header such as 'Commit:', 'Author:'
  hi gitmessengerHeader term=None guifg=#88b8f6 ctermfg=111

  " Commit hash
  hi gitmessengerHash term=None guifg=#f0eaaa ctermfg=229

  " Normal color. This color is the most important
  hi gitmessengerPopupNormal term=None guifg=#eeeeee guibg=#333333 ctermfg=255 ctermbg=234

  " Color of 'end of buffer'. To hide '~' in popup window, I recommend to use the same background
  " color as gitmessengerPopupNormal.
  hi gitmessengerEndOfBuffer term=None guifg=#333333 guibg=#333333 ctermfg=234 ctermbg=234
<
